# 2Tip
Custom Tip Calculator

This is a basic tip calculator app. I made 1 following the steps outlined by CodePath, and another from scratch with a slightly different UI.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Required: User can input a bill amount and see tip amounts for that bill Optional: Custom number-pad instead of invoking default iOS keyboard

Notes:

Much of my time was spent troubleshooting and writing/rewriting the code. I sought out help from a friend who taught me a simpler way to right the code (was previously following a YouTube example) and how to use animations. Walkthrough of all user stories:
